# Benchmark harness

Measures suggestion quality against real Fog of World data, headless under Node.
Needs a `Sync/` folder in the repo root (gitignored: it is personal location
history, never commit it).

```
node bench/characterize.js          # defog density maps; pick scenario centres
node bench/run.js [out] [filter]    # run the app's SuggestTool on bench/scenarios.js
node bench/overpass.js [filter]     # street-network context (total vs undefogged km)
```

- `lib/load.js` loads the real `app/src` parser + suggest code over a Leaflet stub,
  so benchmarks exercise the exact shipping algorithm.
- `lib/gain.js` replicates `computeGain`/`cellIsNew` from `main.js` (kept in sync by hand).
- All BRouter/Overpass responses are disk-cached in `bench/cache/` (gitignored):
  re-runs are free, reproducible, and kind to the public servers. Delete the cache
  to re-measure live. Avoid live runs while also testing in the browser: brouter.de
  throttles per IP.
- Results land in `bench/out/<name>.json` (gitignored) with per-card metrics:
  defogged area, m² per metre, % new ground, overlap %, elongation
  (1 = round blob, 3+ = a proper thin "line" of a loop).
